                    <h2>Abdul Qadeer Khan's Early Life and Early Career</h2>
                    <p>At the time of his birth in the mid-1930s, Abdul Qadeer Khan was born into the British Raj, or
                        British India, which included several nation-states such as modern-day India and Pakistan. Khan
                        was born at a time when the nations of India and Pakistan longed to be free of colonial rule. By
                        the early 1940s, World War II was underway, and British India was a critical location for allied
                        forces to combat Japanese forces in southeast Asia. Despite several uprisings within British
                        India, Britain retained power throughout the war. At the conclusion of World War II, Britain was
                        concerned by tensions continuing to grow in India and was aware of religious tensions among
                        Hindus and Muslims. The crown was also concerned about the danger to British citizens from a
                        previous mutiny. As a result, Britain sought to transfer the power of the British Raj to its
                        people swiftly.</p>

                <h3>Abdul Qadeer Khan and Nuclear Proliferation</h3>
                <p>In the early 1970s, tensions between Pakistan and India were high. The Eastern portion of Pakistan
                    sought independence from the rest of the nation. Initially, the efforts of the separatists were
                    crushed until India provided support. As a result, Eastern Pakistan gained independence and became
                    the nation of Bangladesh. This defeat was an embarrassment to the nation of Pakistan and increased
                    tensions with India In 1974, India tested its first nuclear weapon, and Pakistani authorities took
                    notice. By September of that year, Khan wrote to Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to share his
                    knowledge and expertise in nuclear weapons development. He encouraged Bhutto to consider a
                    uranium-based nuclear program and not the plutonium-based program that Pakistan was currently
                    pursuing. During this time, Khan had also translated documents concerning more advanced centrifuges
                    from German to Dutch unsupervised by his Dutch employers.
